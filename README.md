# WebAutomationChallenge-Fyber
This contains solution of Web automation challenge given.

Summary Notes:

1. Given challenge has been automates using selenium webdriver through Junit test
2. There are 3 test annotations has been created for 3 scenarios for which two packages has been created. One for test and other for page objects to organize common classes created under a same namespace.
3. All 3 tests can be run together in one go, and the test run results are shown for test suite as well as for individual tests.
4. If any further tests need to be added it can be added in test script easily with less effort.
5. Using page objects maintainance of the scripts is very easy, any changes required can be done in respective page object and same will be reflected for all the tests using respective page objects.
6. In the main test I have intentionally kept the 2nd & 3rd test scenario verification code under @test, i.e. just for an explanation.
7. Sample Junit xml test run report is attached for your reference.

Looking forward to discuss any questions !!
